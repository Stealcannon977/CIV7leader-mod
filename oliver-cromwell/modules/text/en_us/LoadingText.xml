			<Text>Oliver Cromwell dismantled the English Monarchy, arguably only to rebuild it again. He led an unprecedented moral and military challenge against the divine right of Kings, culminating in the execution of the Charles I of England. Through this, England entered an era of political radicalism, with mass movements and works of political philosophy which laid the groundwork for what we would now call socialism, liberalism, and democracy. He, however, was not a radical or a democrat. Under his rule, this hopeful moment was swiftly quashed, as he established himself as a dictator: a King in all but name. </Text>
